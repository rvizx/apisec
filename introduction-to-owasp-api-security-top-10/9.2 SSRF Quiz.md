Question 1
What is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?
An attack where an attacker uses the server as a proxy to hide malicious activities.
An attack where the attacker controls remote resources retrieved by a server.
An attack that can be used to expose private data and scan the victim's internal network.*
*All of the above.


Question 2
What is a potential consequence of an SSRF vulnerability?
The server can be used as a proxy to hide malicious activities.
Information disclosure, bypassing firewalls, or other security mechanisms.
It can lead to DoS.
*All of the above.*


Question 3
Which of the following is NOT a preventative measure against SSRF?
Validate and sanitize all client-supplied input data.
Disable HTTP redirections.
Use a well-tested and maintained URL parser to avoid issues caused by URL parsing inconsistencies.
*Enable X-SSRF Headers*


Question 4
What is a key characteristic of SSRF exploitation?
Requires the attacker to send malicious emails.
*Requires the attacker to find an API endpoint that receives a URI as a parameter and then accesses the provided URI.*
Requires the attacker to break into the physical server.
Requires the attacker to create a false user account.


Question 5
What could be a business risk from successful exploitation of SSRF?
It could lead to internal services enumeration or information disclosure.
It could lead to the server being used as a proxy.
It could bypass firewalls or other security mechanisms.
*All of the above*.
