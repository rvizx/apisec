Question 1
###### What are the primary factors that drove the creation of the OWASP API Security Top 10?

The rapid adoption of web APIs
A major gap in security and the prevalence of APIs as a leading attack vector
The ease with which an attacker can exploit a vulnerable API
*All of the above*



Question 2
###### In the absence of community data contribution, how was the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10 list compiled?

Based solely on the project team's personal experiences
*Based on internal research using publicly available data such as bug bounty platforms and news*
Solely based on bug bounty publications
Based only on API-related breach data



Question 3
###### What is the purpose of mapping the OWASP API Security Top 10 risks to external sources like CWE and NIST?

*To provide additional insight and depth into the identified risks*
To create a unique identifier or CWE-ID for each risk
To make the list more comprehensive and difficult to understand
None of the above



Question 4
###### What is the significance of APIs in the modern business landscape?

*APIs allow businesses to use the functionality of other applications without needing to specialize in all aspects of creating software*
APIs are a major security threat to businesses
APIs enable the slow and safe transfer of data within a business
All of the above


Question 5
###### What is a leading challenge posed by APIs in terms of security?

APIs were not considered important enough to warrant specialized security tools
*Traditional network security monitoring tools, web application scanners, and enterprise vulnerability management programs were not designed to handle the unique challenges posed by APIs*
APIs were designed to be inherently secure and did not pose any challenges
The API scanners are riddled with false-positive results
