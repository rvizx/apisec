Decreased user satisfaction
*Increased management resources and expanded attack surface*
Increased network bandwidth usage

Question 2
Which of the following can aid an attacker in identifying improperly managed APIs?

The server's response times
The number of concurrent API users
The server's IP address

Question 3
Which of the following is the most severe impact related to API inventory management?
Outdated API documentation
Information dislosure
Verbose errors
*Enables an attacker to exploit other known vulnerabilities*

Question 4
Which of the following is an indication that an API has a "data flow blindspot"?
Increased data redundancy
*There is no visibility of which type of sensitive data is shared*
Improved system reliability
Enhanced API response times

Question 5
Which of the following practices can help mitigate risks associated with improper API inventory management?
