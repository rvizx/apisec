Question 1
How does OWASP describe the risk regarding Unsafe Consumption of APIs?
*Developers will tend to adopt weaker security standards*
APIs could have an increased number of dependencies
Developers will tend to adopt stronger security standards
Developers will be able to compromise third parties


Question 2
What is a potential risk when an API interacts with othaer APIs over an unencrypted channel?
Enhanced system reliability
Faster throughput of data
*Exposure of sensitive information due to cleartext transmission*
Decreased system scalability


Question 3
Why is it important to maintain an allow list of well-known locations integrated APIs may redirect to?
To increase the number of available resources for processing third-party services responses
*To avoid blindly following redirects and potential security threats*
To increase the speed of API interactions
To encourage the usage of unencrypted channels for interactions


Question 4
What is a crucial step to ensure the security of data received from integrated APIs?
Always process data as soon as it is received
Always follow redirects without any verification
Ignore the need for a secure communication channel
*Validate and properly sanitize data before using it*


Question 5
What could be a potential outcome of weaker security standards in API integrations?
Improved API performance
Exposure of unsupported API versions to the Internet
*Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors*
Increased system scalability
