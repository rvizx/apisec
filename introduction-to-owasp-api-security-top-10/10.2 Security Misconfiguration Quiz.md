Question 1
Which of the following is a potential outcome of having a security misconfiguration in an API?
Disclosure of sensitive user data
Full server compromise due to revealed system details
API documentation may be outdated
*Both A and B*


Question 2
What can happen if Transport Layer Security (TLS) is missing in an API?
Sensitive information can be disclosed through the API documentation
*Attackers can intercept and read the API data being communicated over the network*
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy can be manipulated
All of the above



Question 3
Which of the following is NOT a security misconfiguration?
Use of default accounts
Acceptance of unnecessary HTTP methods
*Exposing an unsupported version of the API*
Verbose error messaging



Question 4
Which of the following is NOT a recommended measure for preventing API security misconfigurations?
*Allow all HTTP verbs for each API*
Where applicable, define and enforce all API response payload schemas
Implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy on APIs expected to be accessed from browser-based clients
Ensure that all API communications happen over an encrypted communication channel (TLS)


Question 5
How can security misconfigurations in an API be detected?
Through web application vulnerability scanners like Burp Suite, Nessus, Qualys, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto
Manually, by inspecting the headers, SSL certificate, cookies, and parameters
By monitoring network traffic and developing expected workflows
*Both A and B*
